# Raresh's Homepage

This is the homepage I've made to launch off into what I usually need to go online.

This was originally a flat GitHub Pages website, but I've now updated it to use [Parcel] with [Less] and [TypeScript] so I can use higher level tools and make it easier to update.

[less]: http://lesscss.org/
[typescript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
